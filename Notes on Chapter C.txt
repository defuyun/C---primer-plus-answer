class stringBad{
  priivate:
    char *str;
    int len;
    static int num_strings;
}

a static string inside a class has the following property;
the program only creates on copy of a static class variable
regardless of the number of objects created.

the static member is shared by all objects;

you cannot initialize the num_strings in the class
definition so

static int num_strings = 0 X

because declaration doesn't create memory and assigning a 
number needs to create memory to store the number;

stringBad b = "xxxxx";
stringBad a = b;

the 2nd line creates uses copy constructor which the compliler automatically
creates. however this still calls the regular destructor

c++ automatically creates the following member functions:
~ a default constructor
~ a default destructor
~ a copy constructor
~ an assingment operator (=)
~ an address operator
