Friend functions
using friend functions to overload operators;
for binary operators in a class e.g.
class time{
   time operator+(int a);
}
the binary operator takes in 2 parameters, the first one is 
the class variable by default (this pointer is passed in)

outside the class e.g.
time operator+(int a, int b); X

1.overloading a operator outside a class requires at least one
  self defined variable e.g. a struct enum class etc;
  
2.a binary operator would require 2 parameter to be passed in



overlaoding <<
<< usually conbines with std::cout, cout is a ostream variable 
defined in the ostream class. In order to use std::cout << to 
display a self defined class the variable &ostream should be 
passed as the first variable (the stuff on th left side of the
operator) e.g.

ostream &operator<<(ostream &os,time t);

this returns a ostream so you countiniuoly use the << operator e.g.

std::cout << time << int << etc;

if you don't return ostream than you can't << after time.
