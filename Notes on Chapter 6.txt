a character defineing library <ctype> can be used to determine the chatacter.
cin is an ostream and cout is an istream.
to modify files, we could proejfice our own ofstream and istream;

my guess. cin is a ostream with the file pointer stdout, and cout is the istream with file pointer stdin.
therefore we can set our own file pointers using istream and ostream.

when cin read in input, it reads in as char then converts to the appropiate underlying type.
samegoes for cout, it converts the data to char type and displays on the screen

to use I/O you must include <fstream> header and create a ofstream object.
in the fstream header there is a defined class called ofstream which is in the namespace std
