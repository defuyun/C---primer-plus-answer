a character defineing library <ctype> can be used to determine the chatacter.
cin is an ostream and cout is an istream.
to modify files, we could proejfice our own ofstream and istream;

my guess. cin is a ostream with the file pointer stdout, and cout is the istream with file pointer stdin.
therefore we can set our own file pointers using istream and ostream.
