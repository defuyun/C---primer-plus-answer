cin does not read blank characters.
cin starts reading from the first non blank character and ends when it see another blank character
it does not take the blank character from the input stream but leaves it there.
this is fine when your using cin only because the next cin will simply leave that blank character, but keep in
mind that the blank is still in the stream.

cin.getline reads blank characters and it stops when it sees \n or the char limit is exceeded (Char limit is N-1 where N is
the length passed in). cin.getline takes out the \n character from the stream but does not append it to the string. 

getline is the same as cin.getline except it deals with string object rather then char string. it has the same function as 
cin.getline() but does not need to indicate char length.


using the wchar_t charater:

wchar_t is a 2 byte character type used to display unicodes etc. the ASCII character type char is only 1 byte therefore 8bit 
with a max storage of 255 which is not large enough to display all the characters in the world. That's why if we want to 
display characters other than english we need to the 2byte wchar_t;
cin and cout considers stream as bytes of char therefore they are incapable of displaying 2byte chars such as wchar_t. To
display wchar_t there is the wcin, wcout class.
