cin does not read blank characters.
cin starts reading from the first non blank character and ends when it see another blank character
it does not take the blank character from the input stream but leaves it there.
this is fine when your using cin only because the next cin will simply leave that blank character, but keep in
mind that the blank is still in the stream.

cin.getline reads blank characters and it stops when it sees \n or the char limit is exceeded (Char limit is N-1 where N is
the length passed in). cin.getline takes out the \n character from the stream but does not append it to the string. 

getline is the same as cin.getline except it deals with string object rather then char string. it has the same function as 
cin.getline() but does not need to indicate char length.
